### Fausto Gergio

People of Songtooth,

What a joy it is to stand before you today at the beginning of this year’s Harvest Festival—a time of tradition, togetherness, and, of course, abundance. I am both honored and, dare I say, delighted to be part of this vibrant and truly unique community.

The harvest is more than just grain and fruit and fish—it is a symbol of what we can accomplish when we all do our part. Whether in the fields, in the market stalls, our boats for fishing or trade, or in the halls of civic leadership, each of us plays a role in the continued growth and prosperity of our great city.

Let us take this moment to celebrate not only the bounty of the season, but the shared values that make Songtooth strong: diligence, harmony, and a steadfast commitment to excellence.

May your tables be full, your spirits high, and your ledgers balanced.

People of Songtooth,

Greetings. I hope you are—well. Or at least not terribly unwell. That would be... unfortunate.

I stand before you today because—well, because it is Harvest Festival.  And although there are concerns that I have heard -- um, [refers to notes sotto voce], including a ... dragon? that's not right, is it? -- I assure you that we are looking into all of them with equal seriousness. Even the goose terrorizing the marketplace.  [sotto voce] Really? A goose?

[CLEARLY scripted]
Songtooth is a city of strength. Of resilience. We have seen worse, and we have endured it. Together.

Remain calm, remain kind, and try not to encourage the goose.

Long live Songtooth.

People of Songtooth,

Hear me now—and hear me well.

Recently, my home was reduced to smoldering ruin by cowards who strike from shadows. They think fire and fear will shake me. That ash and rubble will break this city’s spine. That lawlessness and chaos will fall like a shadow across Songtooth.

They are *wrong*.

I will not waver. Songtooth will not bend.

To the noble Order of Selune: your swift aid to the wounded was nothing short of divine. While stone crumbled, your hands held firm. For that, I thank you—publicly and with deep respect.

But let it be known: those responsible for this outrage will face justice. Not petty justice. Not whispered justice. But justice delivered with the full weight of the law—and if necessary, by my own hand.

I will rebuild stronger. I will stand taller. And I will *not* rest until every last serpent who dared to strike at me, and at Songtooth, is dragged into the light.

Order will prevail. Let them come. Let them try again.

Songtooth stands eternal. And so do I.

Citizens of Songtooth,

I come before you this Harvest Festival both with joy and sadness.  Joy for our annual festival [reveals mismatched socks], but also to address the unfortunate events of recent days. The fire at Veramy Hall was a tragedy—deeply regrettable. Our thoughts are with those affected, and I commend the Order of Selune, as well as the public and members of the Black Talons for their—ah—timely intervention. Lives were saved, and that is what matters most.

Songtooth, for those of us who have lived here, know that its ... rambunctiousness.. is its structure. A way of doing things. And we will continue to uphold that freedom, that way of life.

*Pause.*

We must also remain... vigilant. Against those who would upset not just the facade, but the structure underneath it.
Songtooth is a proud city. Resilient. And though some of us have lost—significantly—we must look ahead. Rebuilding is not just possible; it is... necessary. Practical. Expected.  It may not always look the same on the outside -- [nervous laugh] Arthur had always talked about redoing the roof -- [pause as the joke falls flat].  Er.

I trust in this city's institutions. I trust in our process. And I trust—mm—yes, I trust that the appropriate parties are watching. Closely.

Thank you.
