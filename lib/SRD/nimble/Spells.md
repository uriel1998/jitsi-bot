### Mana  

Using Mana to fuel spells eases bookkeeping and increases spellcasting flexibility.  

- Spells costs mana equal to their level.
- Mana recovers on a long rest.

For example, casting a level 4 spell costs 4 mana, as does upcasting a level 1 spell at 4th level.

  

#### Mana Pools  

For full spellcasters (Bard, Wizard, etc.) their maximum mana pool is equal to their number of spell slots + their spellcaster level.

For half-casters (Paladin, Ranger) their maximum mana pool is equal to their spellcaster level + their proficiency bonus.

  

### Concentration Checks

Concentration checks need to be made when a character receives a critical hit or is damaged by a saving throw spell such as _fireball_, or otherwise at the GM's discretion.
