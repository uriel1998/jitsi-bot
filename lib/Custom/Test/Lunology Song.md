Boar keeps field and Squirrel runs,
Lynx sees truths and Trout hums on.
Fox tells tales and Hare runs fast,
Raven seeks and Badger lasts.

Horse flares hot, then cools the same,
Sheep keeps wool and old-world name.
Pheasant dreams and Owl asks why,
Lion waits with patient eye.

Hedgehog hopes and Bear will share,
Deer steps soft with careful care.
Coyote calls, Beaver is bound—
Soft, soft steps, the moon goes round.

Some moons drift and do not stay,
Some songs fade before their day.
Count them once, then count anew—
Not all signs will answer you.
