**Important**: On the Public meet.jit.si Server you need to open the Room first manually.
Send a Private Message to the Bot with a command.

For a different Domain you need to pass additional parameters to the URL:

```js
// join params with &
domain // domain as listed in config.hosts (e.g. meet.jit.si)
bosh // BOSH URL (e.g. https://meet.jit.si/http-bind) can often be omitted
wsKeepAlive //(Websocket Keep Alive URL, without domain) can often be omitted
useTurnUdp // (No Value)
disableAnonymousdomain // (No Value)

Concatenating recording chunks with ffmpeg

Place all chunk files in one directory with names like:
recording_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_part0001.webm
recording_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_part0002.webm
...

1) Create a concat list file named chunk_list.txt
Each line must reference one chunk file in order:
file 'recording_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_part0001.webm'
file 'recording_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_part0002.webm'

2) Run ffmpeg

Windows (PowerShell):
ffmpeg -f concat -safe 0 -i .\chunk_list.txt -c copy .\recording_merged.webm

Linux (bash):
ffmpeg -f concat -safe 0 -i ./chunk_list.txt -c copy ./recording_merged.webm

macOS (zsh/bash):
ffmpeg -f concat -safe 0 -i ./chunk_list.txt -c copy ./recording_merged.webm

If your files are out of order, sort them by part number before creating chunk_list.txt.
