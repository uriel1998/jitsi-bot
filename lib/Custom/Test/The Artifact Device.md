Form
The device is roughly cylindrical in shape, and about one meter long, with a 50cm diameter. It cannot be accurately depicted through visual mediums such as drawing, since its composition is complex and seems to defy natural law, and it looks different from different angles.

It is unexpectedly light for its size, weighing only 8 to 10 pounds. It isn't difficult to move, only awkward, but it has a strange inertia. If you let go of it, it will defy gravity and stay in place mid-air.

Function
The device uses channeled energy to change the "magnetism" of the world/reality, like turning on an electromagnet to achieve a specific effect. Its original purpose was said to be repelling other worlds, in order to prevent problematic friction and protect this "sandwich". It could also be "tuned" to attract rather than repel, increasing the friction between worlds or allowing otherworldly incursions. The intensity of these effects can be adjusted, and it might have other capabilities.

It is agnostic in what kinds of energies it can use for this purpose—it can intake magical energy from "the Weave", or it can be powered by other energetic sources, such as a soul.

History
Selune explained that in the past, people figured out ways to prevent friction between the worlds, and that this device was one method of doing so. Hundreds of years ago, she charged the dogfolk with the protection of this particular device, insisting that secrecy was its best defense. For sake of keeping the device safe, Selune made herself forget about its existence.

It was stolen once before, about ten years ago, by two humans who used it for some "unpleasant" purpose. The dogfolk retrieved it shortly after that event.

Most recently, it was stolen by Tailara and her "assistant" in the wee hours of Harvestmoon 26.
