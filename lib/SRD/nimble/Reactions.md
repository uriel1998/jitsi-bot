# Nimble Reactions

### Special Reactions

Special reactions include Held Actions and reactions granted by subclass features, feats, and spells (eg. _shield, absorb elements_). As per the rules you're familiar with, **you can take 1 special reaction per round**.

### Heroic Reactions  

Everyone has access to the following five heroic reactions. **You can take 2 heroic reactions per round**, but they must be two different reactions.

Note: You can Interpose and Defend at the same time, as long as you have two heroic reactions available.

#### Assess

In combat, make a skill check to uncover information, spot a weakness, intuit enemy tactics/plans, etc.

#### Defend

Reduce damage from any single attack by your AC modifier (AC -8). At the GM’s discretion, some damage may not be avoidable (i.e., psychic damage, some areas of effect).

#### Help

Grant an ally advantage on a roll if you can reasonably explain to the GM how you could help in a given situation. The GM may call for a skill check or grant advantage automatically.

#### Interpose

When a creature within 10 ft. of you is targeted by an attack, you can push them out of the way and become the target of the attack. You enter their space and move them to an adjacent space of your choice.

#### Opportunity Attack

When you and an ally are adjacent to a creature and it willingly moves out of your reach, half of the adjacent PCs (rounded down) may make one melee attack targeting that creature.
