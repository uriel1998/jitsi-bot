# Nimble Attacks
### Nimble Attacks

- To attack, simply roll your damage die.
- For attacks with multiple dice, the die that rolls first (or is leftmost in the formula) is the Primary Die. The Primary Die determines whether the attack is a hit, miss, or crit.
- Rolling a 1 on the die is a miss and deals no damage.
- Rolling the highest number on the Primary Die is a critical hit—the Primary Die is rolled again and added to the damage total.

### Critical Hits

- There is no limit to how many times your Primary Die can explode.
- Critical hits ignore armor.

### Saving Throw Spells

Saving throw spells ignore armor, do not miss on a 1, and cannot critically hit.

### Advantage & Disadvantage

When you roll with advantage or disadvantage, roll an extra die and remove the lowest (for advantage) or the highest (for disadvantage).

### Attack Examples  

#### Weapon Attacks

Grudge, the Fighter, wields a battleaxe and rolls 1d8. He rolls an 8—a critical hit! Grudge rolls again, and gets another 8! Rolling a 3rd time he gets a 1. 8+8+1 damage, plus his STR modifier of +3, brings it to a total of 20 damage for that attack.  

#### Spell Attacks

Glow, the Cleric, casts _guiding bolt_ and rolls 4d6: 6, 5, 3, and 1. A critical hit! She will roll only the Primary Die again for the critical hit damage. Getting a 4 on it, she deals 19 damage altogether.

On her next turn, Glow casts _guiding bolt_ again. This time, she gets a 1 on the Primary Die and the attack misses.  

#### Extra Damage Dice

Fletch, the Ranger, attacks a creature that they have marked with _hunter's mark_. Rolling 1d6 for their shortbow, they get a 6! They get to roll 1d6 for their _hunter's mark_ damage, but only the shortbow’s Primary Die (d6) is rolled again (and possibly again!) for the critical hit damage.
