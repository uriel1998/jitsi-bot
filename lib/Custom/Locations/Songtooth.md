Songtooth is purportedly a representative democracy; in reality it's controlled by a number of powerful families and business interests.

### **Centertown**

Mercantile mixed use. Where the trading tends to happen. Also where what law there is tends to be focused, such as the Talons, the Civinius Group, and so on. Violent crime is infrequent, and hidden.

- \[\[The Scaled Boar\]\]

### **Mistchurch Garden**

Several temples -- some of which are multifaith -- make their home here. This is not *all* of the temples, just the affluent ones.

### **The Harbor**

Working class, rough and tumble. Some violent crime is evident (fistfights, bar brawls, pickpocketing, drug use). Transitory types tend to end up here.

### **Rolla**

Production working class and lower-middle class professionals. Scribes to smithies.

### **Oak Hills**

- Feldwyn Manor
- Devonsea Manor
- Veramy Manor

Affluent folks, at least toward Centertown and Mistchurch Garden, but gets more facade-like the further west you go.

### **Four Towers**

A lot of agricultural-related industry and general housing. Butchers, leatherworkers, textiles.

### **Rose Stair**

Hovels and encampments. Skid row. Slums. Etc. Can be dangerous, but also has a strong community spirit as well.
